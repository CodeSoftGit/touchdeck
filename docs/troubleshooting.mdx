## Media / MPRIS

- Ensure a player that implements MPRIS is running (Spotify, VLC, etc.).
- If nothing appears, restart the player, then Touchdeck.
- DBus errors: verify you have a session bus (running under X/Wayland on Linux).

## Spotify

- "Spotify is not signed in": redo the Settings → Spotify sign-in flow.
- "Playback state not available": ensure your Spotify client is active and the selected device is online.
- Cover art missing: local files may not ship art via Web API; this is expected.

## GPU stats

- Install `nvidia-ml-py` and verify the NVIDIA driver is present.
- Toggle GPU stats off/on from Quick Actions to reinitialize NVML.

## Speed test

- Install `speedtest-cli` (`pip install speedtest-cli`).
- Network failures are surfaced in the Speed Test card; try again on a stable link.

## Display and input

- Qt must reach a display; SSH without X forwarding will fail to show a window.
- Touch input is synthesized from mouse events when missing; true touch works out of the box on Linux.

## Settings

- Corrupt settings file? Delete `~/.config/touchdeck/settings.json` and relaunch.
- Pages missing: ensure `enabled_pages` contains them; `settings` is always added automatically.
