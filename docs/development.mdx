description: 'Work on Touchdeck and its docs locally'
---

## Project layout

- App code: `touchdeck/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Docs (this site): `docs/`
- Settings + caches at runtime: `~/.config/touchdeck/`

## Dev environment

<Steps>
<Step title="Install dev dependencies">

```bash
uv venv
uv sync --dev
```

This installs PySide6, qasync, psutil, NVML bindings (optional), Spotipy, and test tools.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the app locally">

```bash
uv run touchdeck
# or: python -m touchdeck
```

Use `--display` flags? Not needed—the app prompts you to pick a screen on first launch.
</Step>

<Step title="Run tests">

```bash
uv run pytest
```

For coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-report=xml --cov-report html:cov_html
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Code style and linting

- The codebase is type-hinted; prefer mypy-friendly changes.
- Keep UI styles consistent with `touchdeck/themes.py` and widget helpers.
- Avoid blocking the Qt event loop—use `asyncio.to_thread` where needed.

## Working on docs

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

</Step>

<Step title="Preview docs">

```bash
cd docs
mint dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the docs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Where to contribute
