---

Touchdeck ships with several swipeable pages. You can reorder or hide them (except Settings) via `enabled_pages` in settings.

## Music

- Controls play/pause/next/previous for the active provider (MPRIS or Spotify).
- Seek slider honors provider capabilities (MPRIS `CanSeek`, Spotify always true).
- Displays cover art (data URLs or HTTP) and metadata; falls back gracefully.
- Synced lyrics via LRCLIB with inline status messages and caching.

## Stats

- CPU percent, RAM usage, and optional GPU/VRAM usage via NVML.
- Updates on `stats_poll_ms`; GPU rows hide automatically if disabled.

## Speed Test

- Runs `speedtest-cli` in a worker thread and shows download/upload/ping.
- Handles missing dependency with a friendly error.

## Clock

- Large clock tuned for 800x480. Supports 12/24h and optional seconds.

## Emoji

- Tap to copy frequently used emoji (including clipboard-friendly text faces).
- Uses bundled Noto SVG emoji where available; falls back to text.

## Developer

- Shows current theme, UI scale, opacity, demo mode, GPU toggle, and enabled pages.
- Lists recent warnings/errors emitted by the app.

## Settings

- Central place to adjust media source, theme, display choices, quick actions, and Spotify auth.
- Editing settings here writes to `~/.config/touchdeck/settings.json` immediately.
