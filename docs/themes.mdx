Touchdeck includes preset themes defined in `touchdeck/themes.py`:

- Midnight (default)
- Glacier
- Sunset
- Dawn
- Aurora
- Berry
- Neon

Each theme sets gradients, text/subtle colors, panel/background shades, slider and progress hues. The Settings page lets you switch themes at runtime; changes are applied instantly via Qt style sheets.

## UI scale and opacity

- `ui_scale_percent` scales all Qt widgets (sets `QT_SCALE_FACTOR`); range 25–200.
- `ui_opacity_percent` dims the window for kiosk-style setups; range 50–100.
- Demo mode keeps the window resizable; normal mode opens full screen.

## Displays

On first launch, a dialog lets you choose which display to target and whether to enter demo mode. Choices persist in settings.

## Fonts and rounding

- Rounded corners are controlled by `touchdeck/constants.py` (`CORNER_RADIUS = 24`).
- The UI uses a modern sans stack (`Inter` → `SF Pro` → `Segoe UI` → `Noto Sans` → fallback sans).
