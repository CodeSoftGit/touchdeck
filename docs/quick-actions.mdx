The quick actions drawer opens with an upward swipe from the bottom edge (or mouse drag) and closes with a downward swipe. Actions are large, touch-friendly buttons.

## Built-in actions

- `play_pause` — toggle playback on the current media provider
- `next_track` — skip forward
- `prev_track` — go back
- `run_speedtest` — start a new speed test
- `toggle_gpu` — enable/disable GPU stats at runtime

Default order: play/pause, next track, run speed test.

## Custom actions

Create custom shell commands from the Settings page. Each action is stored as `{key, title, command, timeout_ms}` in `custom_actions`.

- Keys are slugified; collisions are suffixed (`custom-foo-2`).
- Commands run via `subprocess.Popen(shell=True)` with live output streamed to the drawer.
- `timeout_ms` defaults to 8000 and is clamped between 500 and 300000 ms.
- Actions can be canceled while running.

## Ordering and visibility

- The drawer respects the order in `quick_actions` (unknown keys are filtered).
- If the list becomes empty, defaults are restored automatically.
- Custom actions appear alongside built-ins when their keys are listed.
