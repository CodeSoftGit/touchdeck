Touchdeck is a touch-first "stream deck" UI for 800x480-ish landscape displays. It wraps your media controls, live lyrics, system stats, and a swipe-up quick actions drawer into a single PySide6 app.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Linux desktop with D-Bus (for MPRIS) and a compatible media player (Spotify, VLC, etc.)
- Optional: NVIDIA drivers + `nvidia-ml-py` for GPU stats; `speedtest-cli` for speed tests; Spotify client credentials for Spotify mode
- Small landscape touchscreen (default layout is 800x480); mouse/trackpad also works

## How Touchdeck is built

- PySide6 for UI, qasync to bridge Qt's event loop with asyncio
- Media providers: MPRIS and Spotify (`touchdeck/services/mpris.py`, `touchdeck/services/spotify_provider.py`)
- Stats: psutil and optional NVML (`touchdeck/services/stats.py`)
- Settings stored at `~/.config/touchdeck/settings.json` (`touchdeck/settings.py`)
- UI pages and widgets under `touchdeck/ui/`
